#first path will get the question to go through the grass field or go through the forest. grass field = death bc warthog and if through forest they reach lab
#second path dodges the field and reaches the lab
#after the two lines above they go into the same path at last
#choice to be made, go through door or window
#If door the crabs storm out at you, rest in piece. If through window you land on top of a kitchen counter unscathed
#you see a circular water tank in the middle of the room.
#In the water tank you see a glowing crystal/ pearl thingy that looks like something important that you need.
#There is one problem however, there is alot of crabs, and it looks like they are doing research on the bioluminecent pearl
#There are tools in the kitchen where you stand. Scizzor, sledgehammer and knife
#Destroy water tank and get pearl. sledgehammer is of course correct
#Run away from the crabs
#The crabs are less heat resistant than you.
#The pearl makes it cooler around you.
